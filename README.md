# PaintProgam
This is a simple paint program. It utilizes java and specific libraries of java to build the graphical and listening components of the project. Additionally, I utilized different data structures, such as stacks and arraylists, to add the features of saving and unsaving certain parts of the painting. Also, I added color palettes to the program, so that the use could adjust values of the HSV, HSL, RGB, and CMUV to get his or her's true unique color. The final feature of this project is that I used a FileIo library so that the user has the ability to load/save their paintings.
